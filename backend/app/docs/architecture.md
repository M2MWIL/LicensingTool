# Backend Architecture

## Overview
This backend architecture is designed to support a Licensing Risk Prediction system. The system integrates a machine learning model (Random Forest), natural language generation for explanations (using GPT-based LLM), and visualization of feature importance. The backend exposes an API that processes incoming requests, performs predictions, and returns a response that includes the prediction, explanation, and feature importance.

## Core Components
1. API: Flask-based API to handle user requests.
2. Machine Learning Model: Random Forest model for risk prediction.
3. Natural Language Processing: LLM (GPT) integration for generating explanations.
4. Feature Importance Visualization: Spider chart for feature importance display.
5. Data Processing: Preprocessing and encoding of input data for prediction.

## Architecture Components

1. Flask API
- Technology: Flask
- Purpose: Acts as the API layer that receives POST requests, processes data, and returns predictions along with explanations and visualizations.

Endpoints:
- POST /predict
- Accepts: JSON input with feature data.
- Returns: Risk prediction, decision path explanation, and feature importance.

2. Machine Learning Model
- Technology: Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Purpose: Predicts risk classifications based on the input data.
- Model: The Random Forest classifier is used to classify risk levels into "Low", "Moderate", or "High".

Feature Importance:
The model returns the importance of each feature for the prediction, which is visualized in the spider chart.

3. Natural Language Processing (LLM)
- Technology: GPT-4 API (OpenAI)
- Purpose: Generates explanations of the machine learning modelâ€™s decision paths for each prediction.
- Process: The LLM is prompted with the decision path and feature values to generate a detailed explanation.

4. Data Processing
- Processor Class: Applies weights to categorical features and encodes them for the Random Forest model.
- Handling Missing Data: The backend applies default values or scales based on the data distribution if required.

## Flow of Data
1. User Input: User submits enterprise data via frontend.
2. API Request: The frontend sends a JSON request to the /predict endpoint.
3. Data Preprocessing: The backend processes the input data (e.g., applying weights and encoding).
4. Prediction: The Random Forest model predicts risk classifications.
5. LLM Explanation: The LLM generates an explanation of the prediction based on the decision path.
6. Feature Importance: Feature importance is calculated and visualized in a spider chart.
7. Response: The API returns the prediction, explanation, and feature importance, which are then displayed on the frontend.

## Future Considerations

- Scaling: As the number of users grows, Flask may need to be replaced with a more scalable framework (e.g., FastAPI).
- Model Updates: The machine learning model should be regularly retrained with updated data to maintain accuracy.
- Security: Ensure the API is secured, especially for sensitive enterprise data. Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to protect API endpoints.
